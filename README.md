Favicodes: Generate favicons from unicode
=========================================


Introduction
===============

Say you're building a new website and you'd like a nice favicon, but you don't
want the hassle of making one. Favicodes is a service to dynamically generate favicons from unicode characters. 
(A singular favicode is a favicon generated from Unicode.) Favicodes can be further 
customized through GET query parameters. This makes it quick and easy for 
anyone to generate a favicode without leaving the text editor.

Features
========

- Favicodes may contain up to 2 glyphs, side by side
- Generates png or ico output (png default)
- Font defaults to Google Noto Sans (Mostly Latin characters by default for now, all character sets supported by Noto will eventually be supported in all styles)
- Can also generate any of the glyphs from FontAwesome Free 5.8.1
- FontAwesome glyphs can be specified by hex Unicode code point or their proper names, eg. "f005" or "star"
- But wait, all characters can be specified by their Unicode code point
- Text can be resized, colored or placed anywhere on the x, y axes
- All font styles available for both FontAwesome Free and Google Noto Sans
